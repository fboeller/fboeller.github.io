    "excerpt": "Subtype polymorphism is great for adding more entity types. Pattern matching is a better choice for adding more functionality. In many use cases, itâ€™s likelier that more functionality is requested than that more entity types are requested. In this article, we implement a program based on a set of simple requirements. First, we implement it using subtype polymorphism, then using pattern matching. Given these implementations, we add two more requirements and compare the necessary changes to implement the new requirements."

Thus, I'm asking if there is any way to build a String that concatenates the output of the toString() method from the instances in a single line."

In this live coding session, I'll share how we set up isolated test cases for a real world microservice. We'll explore how to spin up a PostgresQL database with testcontainers and what issues you might run into. We'll discuss other external dependencies of a micro service and how and to what degree you can test these."
